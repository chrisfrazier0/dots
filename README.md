## FAQ 🛸

**Q: Where are my dotfiles stored?**  
A: In your `DOTFILE_PATH` (default: `~/.dotfiles`). Files are organized into `home/` for user configs and `root/` for system-wide ones.

**Q: What if I mess up?**  
A: Run `dots diff` to spot issues, or use git to revert changes. Your repo is your safety net!

**Q: Can I use Dots without git?**  
A: Git is required for repo initialization and tracking, but Dots makes it easy to track, commit, and push.
